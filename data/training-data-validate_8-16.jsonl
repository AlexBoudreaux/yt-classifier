Since you can't feel the detents through the video, make sure to turn up the volume so you can at least hear them, particularly the fine-grained detents toward the end of the video. A brushless gimbal motor is paired with a magnetic encoder to provide closed-loop torque feedback control, enabling virtual endstops and detents. Internally, everything is powered by an ESP32, with a TMC6300 BLDC motor driver, HX711 strain gauge ADC, VEML7700 ambient light sensor, and more! I'll have a lot more to share about this project in the future, like a design and assembly overview, so make sure you're subscribed if you want to see more! And follow me on Twitter (@scottbez1) for mini-updates, like this demo of the PCB-mounted strain gauges: https://twitter.com/scottbez1/status/1499510448864915465 or a sneak-peak of the internals: https://twitter.com/scottbez1/status/1502335685918814212 Open source project: https://github.com/scottbez1/smartknob \ud83d\uded2 Related hobby electronics items (affiliate links help support the channel, at no cost to you): Round 240x240 LCD module (GC9A01): https://amzn.to/3xDpafs (This is a breadboard-friendly module using the same circular LCD panel used in the SmartKnob - useful for prototyping. If you want just the raw LCD panel, see the BOM in the project GitHub for more info) Highly recommended soldering iron - TS100: https://amzn.to/3Olswd0 (I use the Ralim/IronOS firmware, and built a barrel jack extension cable with flexible silicone-insulated dual-core wire for better maneuverability) Load cell amplifier - HX711: https://amzn.to/3uS0b66 (This is a breadboard-friendly module for using the same HX711 load cell amplifier used in the SmartKnob for detecting force applied downward on the knob, along with the strain gauges below) Strain gauges BF350-3AA: https://amzn.to/3uQLSij (Strain gauges like these are used to measure the PCB flex to detect presses on the knob) If you liked this video/project and would like to support other cool projects, I'd love to have your sponsorship support on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/scottbez1/ This project was greatly inspired by @JesseSchoch 's video \"Haptic textures and virtual detents\" so definitely check that out too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gPQfDkX3BU\n</video_description>\n<video_summary>\nThe Smart Knob is an open-source DIY input device that utilizes haptic feedback technology. It consists of a smooth rotary encoder, a round LCD, and RGB LEDs. The device uses low-cost strain gauge sensors and a quick motor vibration to simulate the feeling of pressing a button. What makes this knob unique is that it is mounted to a brushless DC motor, allowing for software-configurable end stops. These end stops can support multiple full revolutions and virtual snap points, providing a satisfying snap when crossing the center point or a spring-loaded knob that always returns to the center. The Smart Knob utilizes a high-resolution magnetic encoder chip for fine-grained control and enables virtual detents to match this high resolution. The size and granularity of these details can be adjusted in real-time, allowing for a seamless rotation experience. This video gives a brief overview of the capabilities of the Smart Knob and invites viewers to explore more about its design and construction through the provided open-source project links.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Arduino/Pi/SmartHome\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

It highlights how the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, concerned about Soviet brainwashing techniques, turned to research on LSD as a potential \"truth drug\" and psychological weapon. The CIA, particularly through figures like Sidney Gottlieb, began to investigate LSD's capabilities, funding research at universities and establishing a network that controlled the distribution and study of the drug. Despite initial academic interest in LSD's potential therapeutic uses, the program evolved into controversial experiments focused on manipulation and control, marking a significant shift in the drug's application from promising treatment to a part of covert warfare strategies. The speaker reflects on the morally complex interplay between military interests and scientific research during this period, suggesting that the misuse of LSD led to its negative reputation and unintended consequences.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nPodcast/Comedy\n</video_classification>"}]}

It begins by discussing how each person has their own frame of reference and how motion is relative. The video then introduces the concept of the speed of light as a constant, which leads to the need for a new understanding of space and time. The video explains the Lorenz transformations, which allow for changes in reference frames while preserving the speed of light. It goes on to discuss special relativity, which involves time and space warping and changing depending on the observer. The video draws an analogy between space-time transformations and rotations on a map, with the Lawrence Transformations being hyperbolic rotations. It explains how these transformations preserve certain aspects of the diagram, like straight lines and volumes. The video also discusses how space-time unifies the concepts of acceleration, electric and magnetic fields, and momentum and energy. It concludes by mentioning that space-time can be distorted, leading to the theory of general relativity, and mentions ongoing research and theories about the nature of space-time at a fundamental level.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Science/History\"\n</video_classification>"}]}
