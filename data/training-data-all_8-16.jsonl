The first idea is a two-sided marketplace, where buyers and sellers can connect and the platform owner can earn commission or subscription fees. Examples of marketplaces include Airbnb and Amazon. The second idea is a software as a service (SaaS) platform, where users pay a subscription fee for access to software. This can be used for inventory management systems, CRM platforms, and reporting dashboards. The third idea is building communities and social networks, where monetization opportunities include selling directly to community members, providing sponsorships, and advertising. The speaker provides a list of no-code tools that can be used to build these startup ideas, such as Softr, Webflow, Airtable, Zapier, Bubble, Sharetribe, Glide, and Adalo.

In this video we go through real-world examples and demonstrate how each component contributes to the effectiveness of the prompt (aka the better the prompt, the better the output)! The Task sentence needs to articulate the end goal and start with an action verb. Use three guiding questions to help structure relevant and sufficient Context. Exemplars can drastically improve the quality of the output by giving specific examples for the AI to reference. For Persona, think of who you would ideally want the AI to be in the given task situation. Visualizing your desired end result will let you know what format to use in your prompt.

The first method is fine-tuning, which involves training the large language model with private data to achieve desired behaviors. The second method is creating a knowledge base, where an embedding or vector database is used to provide relevant data to the language model. Fine-tuning is useful for creating a knowledge model with specific behaviors, while embedding is better for providing accurate data based on domain knowledge. The video also provides a step-by-step case study on how to fine-tune a large language model for creating military prompts using the Falcon model. The speaker explains the process of choosing a model, preparing the dataset, implementing training, and saving and uploading the trained model. The results of fine-tuning are shown to be more effective than using the base model or chat GPT alone. The speaker suggests exploring different use cases for fine-tuning, such as customer support, legal documents, medical diagnosis, and financial advisories. The video concludes by inviting viewers to share their own fine-tuned models and mentioning a future video on creating an embedded knowledge base.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Development/AI\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

Physicists, including Edward Teller and J. Robert Oppenheimer, had concerns about the possibility of igniting the Earth's atmosphere and ending all life. They conducted calculations to determine the safety factor of the blast, considering the energy gains and losses. Although the scientists concluded that the chances of atmospheric ignition were very low, the gravity of the situation was not lost on them. The video highlights the immense power of nuclear weapons and the responsibility that comes with wielding such destructive force.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Science/History\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

It begins by discussing how each person has their own frame of reference and how motion is relative. The video then introduces the concept of the speed of light as a constant, which leads to the need for a new understanding of space and time. The video explains the Lorenz transformations, which allow for changes in reference frames while preserving the speed of light. It goes on to discuss special relativity, which involves time and space warping and changing depending on the observer. The video draws an analogy between space-time transformations and rotations on a map, with the Lawrence Transformations being hyperbolic rotations. It explains how these transformations preserve certain aspects of the diagram, like straight lines and volumes. The video also discusses how space-time unifies the concepts of acceleration, electric and magnetic fields, and momentum and energy. It concludes by mentioning that space-time can be distorted, leading to the theory of general relativity, and mentions ongoing research and theories about the nature of space-time at a fundamental level.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Science/History\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

It was brutal, chaotic, and memorable - still today the event remains a mainstay in Italian history, popular culture and historical intrigue. From the death of a French Duke to the last stand of the Swiss Guard, the 1527 Sack of Rome is a fascinating story of brutality and the horrors of Renaissance era warfare.

The city is undermanned and poorly equipped to defend itself, while the Spanish army, seeking payment and loot, attacks the city's walls. Eventually, the walls are breached and the city is overwhelmed by the enemy. The Imperial army proceeds to engage in looting, violence, and destruction, committing war crimes and causing immense suffering to the residents. The Swiss Guard and some Roman citizens make a last stand in the Vatican, but they are eventually forced to retreat to Castel Sant'Angelo. The city is left in ruins, with churches destroyed, dead bodies filling the streets, and the once prosperous city reduced to chaos and despair. The sack of Rome is described as one of the most devastating events in history, comparable to the destruction of Jerusalem.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Science/History\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

They explain that time is similar to the dimensions of space but is often overlooked or misunderstood. The video explores the idea that time is another direction, just like the three dimensions of space. They use a fictional 2D world as an analogy to explain how objects can move in different directions within different dimensions. The host also explains how time and space are interconnected according to Einstein's theory of relativity. They discuss the concept of time dilation and how objects moving at high speeds appear to flatten in the direction of their travel. The video concludes by suggesting that viewing time as a dimension can deepen our understanding of the universe and raise further questions about the nature of time. The host also mentions a collaboration with their brother on a book about the solar system and encourages viewers to check out their store.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Science/History\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLP What causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging. Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.

He addresses concerns about the potential for increased sickness and inequality, and focuses on extending the healthy lifespan (health span). The host discusses the role of the epigenome in aging and the importance of maintaining it. He explains how certain genes, such as sirtuins, AMP-kinase, and mTOR, can help slow aging and the steps individuals can take to maintain their epigenome. The host also interviews Professor Sinclair, who shares his research on reversing aging in mice by resetting the epigenome. He discusses the possibility of using the jellyfish's ability to reset their cells as a model for human aging. Although reversing aging in the entire human body is still far off, there is a roadmap and potential for slowing and even reversing aging in the future.

With over 100 soldiers on the ground, immerse yourself completely in dynamic battles with an unparalleled combination of realism and approachability. --- In one of the darkest days of the Korean War, The King\u2019s Own Scottish Borderers found themselves in the icy grip of death. Encircled by an unending army of fanatical Chinese soldiers who descended upon the British forces in wave after wave of brutal assaults. As darkness engulfed the land, muzzle fire lit the clash. It quickly devolved into ferocious hand-to-hand encounters threatening to break the British front line. Then, like a gut punch, the chilling news echoed across the radios; the force holding the critical left shoulder of the Company\u2019s position had been decimated, and the remaining forces were overrun. It was over. Hearing the news, \u201cBill\u201d Speakman decided he would not let his comrades be overwhelmed and trampled by the enemy. He hoarded as many grenades as he could carry and catapulted himself toward the breach. He became a tempest, hurling grenades at the rushing enemy forces with savage fury, each detonation momentarily stalling the enemy\u2019s advance. Speakman\u2019s defiance stood out like a beacon in the night. Again and again, he faced the enemy head-on, his bravery igniting a flame within 6 comrades, who soon followed suit. Even severely wounded, Speakman refused to stop. When their ammo ran out, he threw beer bottles, tin cans, stones, and anything he could grab at the enemy in a desperate effort to keep them at bay and allow his fellow soldiers a chance to escape. - As images and footage of actual events are not always available, Dark Docs sometimes utilizes similar historical images and footage for dramatic effect.

What is a Roth IRA The Roth IRA is an individual retirement account that anyone can start provided they have something called EARNED income. This means that you need to make wages/salaries/tips, so basically you need to have a pay stub or W2 or 1099 income. You can open a Roth IRA at almost any brokerage firm, and the main advantage of having a Roth IRA is that your earnings and profits are growing tax free. That means when you retire, and you withdraw all the earnings on this account, you won't pay ANY taxes on it. That's the biggest benefit of this account, so since all our earnings grow tax free - there are going to be some investing strategies that we can employ within the Roth IRA to really take advantage of this fact. 2. What's in MY Roth IRA? My Roth IRA has around 29k invested and holds the following: VTI, which is a Total Stock Market ETF - $13k VEU - gives you broad access to international markets that are developing and emerging - about $8.8k BNDW - 4k world bond ETF, this gives me access to bonds in the world VOO - $3.3k S&P 500 ETF. Now initially when I started my Roth IRA, I chose these three funds only, and the split at the time was 40% VTI, 40% VEU, and 20% BND. Now at the time, the reasoning was pretty simple, I was in my late 20s, I wanted to have exposure to the US and International stock markets, which are riskier than bonds, but I didnt want to be 100% in equities - and I wanted a passive investment that I did not have to actively manage, hence why I chose ETFs. Based on my risk tolerance at the time - which was moderate/moderately aggressive for the next 30+ years, I chose an 80/20 split of equities to bonds, and I wanted my equities to be hedged across US and emerging world, just in case something happened with the US market, I still had the international ones to bolster me up. This was diversifying\n</video_description>\n<video_summary>\nIn this video, Humphrey discusses what is in his Roth IRA and provides tips on how to decide what to invest in your own Roth IRA. He starts by explaining the basics of a Roth IRA and its advantages, such as tax-free growth and withdrawals. Humphrey then goes on to share the four funds he holds in his Roth IRA: VTI (total stock market ETF), VEU (international markets ETF), BNDW (world bond ETF), and VO (S&P 500 ETF). He explains his reasoning behind these choices and how he wanted a mix of bonds and equities for diversification. Humphrey also discusses the differences between investing in individual stocks versus ETFs and funds. He emphasizes the importance of assessing risk tolerance, identifying one's investment style, and considering overall portfolio diversification when deciding what to invest in a Roth IRA. He also mentions other investment options like real estate investment trusts (REITs) and dividend stocks. Humphrey concludes by encouraging viewers to watch his video on a simple investing portfolio if they are looking for a straightforward approach.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Finance\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

This involves the use of a 'Learning Agenda,' a structured set of questions to focus your learning during the onboarding process, enabling you to manage information overload effectively. Thirdly, we discuss how to negotiate success with your manager, emphasizing the importance of setting the right expectations and regularly reviewing performance metrics. Finally, we explore how to secure early wins with colleagues, underlining that positive first impressions formed within the first 30 days can set you up for long-term success. *THE NO BS PRODUCTIVITY NEWSLETTER* \ud83d\udce7 https://www.jeffsu.org/productivity-ping/ *TIMESTAMPS* 00:00 What does \u201csuccess\u201d look like for new hires? 00:40 Common onboarding mistakes for new hires 01:02 How to create a virtuous cycle ASAP 01:26 Understand your blindspots 03:42 Accelerate your learning systematically 05:11 Negotiate success with your boss 06:19 Secure early wins with colleagues 07:41 Summary of the First 90 Days *RESOURCES I MENTION IN THE VIDEO* What makes a Great Manager - https://youtu.be/84kPR_NDjI8 Create a 30-60-90 Onboarding Plan - https://youtu.be/Q07rFZtc2Ao *MY FAVORITE GEAR* \ud83c\udfac My YouTube Gear - https://www.jeffsu.org/yt-gear/ \ud83c\udf92 Everyday Carry - https://www.jeffsu.org/my-edc/ *MY TOP 3 FAVORITE SOFTWARE* \u274e CleanShot X - https://geni.us/cleanshotx \u270d\ufe0f Skillshare - https://geni.us/skillshare-jeff \ud83d\udcd6 Readwise - https://readwise.io/jeffsu/ *BE MY FRIEND:* \ud83d\udce7 Subscribe to my Productivity newsletter - https://www.jeffsu.org/productivity-ping/ \ud83d\udcf8 Instagram - https://instagram.com/j.sushie \ud83e\udd1d LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsu05/ *\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb WHO AM I:* I'm Jeff, a tech professional trying to figure life out.

We\u2019re going to have 1,000 shares. He is going to have 500 shares. He is going to own a third of the business for his $500. So what is our business worth at the start?

But we do know from Forbes and Resumebuilder that 46% of job seekers utilize #ChatGPT to assist them, and 69% of those individuals receive more interviews. To make the most of AI assistance, it's essential to provide high-quality prompts at each stage of the job search process. One effective way to utilize ChatGPT is by enhancing your networking skills. For instance, to connect with a professional on #LinkedIn, you can use ChatGPT to analyze their profile and generate a personalized connection request. Moreover, ChatGPT can help you come up with tailored questions to ask during coffee chats, showing the professional that you've done your homework and are serious about learning from them. ChatGPT can also help you compose follow-up emails after an interview, emphasizing your transferable skills and mentioning specific details from the conversation to show you were paying attention. Additionally, ChatGPT can guide you through salary negotiations by simulating a realistic conversation between a job seeker and a recruiter. By practicing with AI-generated responses, you can enter the negotiation process with more confidence and poise.

Since you can't feel the detents through the video, make sure to turn up the volume so you can at least hear them, particularly the fine-grained detents toward the end of the video. A brushless gimbal motor is paired with a magnetic encoder to provide closed-loop torque feedback control, enabling virtual endstops and detents. Internally, everything is powered by an ESP32, with a TMC6300 BLDC motor driver, HX711 strain gauge ADC, VEML7700 ambient light sensor, and more! I'll have a lot more to share about this project in the future, like a design and assembly overview, so make sure you're subscribed if you want to see more! And follow me on Twitter (@scottbez1) for mini-updates, like this demo of the PCB-mounted strain gauges: https://twitter.com/scottbez1/status/1499510448864915465 or a sneak-peak of the internals: https://twitter.com/scottbez1/status/1502335685918814212 Open source project: https://github.com/scottbez1/smartknob \ud83d\uded2 Related hobby electronics items (affiliate links help support the channel, at no cost to you): Round 240x240 LCD module (GC9A01): https://amzn.to/3xDpafs (This is a breadboard-friendly module using the same circular LCD panel used in the SmartKnob - useful for prototyping. If you want just the raw LCD panel, see the BOM in the project GitHub for more info) Highly recommended soldering iron - TS100: https://amzn.to/3Olswd0 (I use the Ralim/IronOS firmware, and built a barrel jack extension cable with flexible silicone-insulated dual-core wire for better maneuverability) Load cell amplifier - HX711: https://amzn.to/3uS0b66 (This is a breadboard-friendly module for using the same HX711 load cell amplifier used in the SmartKnob for detecting force applied downward on the knob, along with the strain gauges below) Strain gauges BF350-3AA: https://amzn.to/3uQLSij (Strain gauges like these are used to measure the PCB flex to detect presses on the knob) If you liked this video/project and would like to support other cool projects, I'd love to have your sponsorship support on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/scottbez1/ This project was greatly inspired by @JesseSchoch 's video \"Haptic textures and virtual detents\" so definitely check that out too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gPQfDkX3BU\n</video_description>\n<video_summary>\nThe Smart Knob is an open-source DIY input device that utilizes haptic feedback technology. It consists of a smooth rotary encoder, a round LCD, and RGB LEDs. The device uses low-cost strain gauge sensors and a quick motor vibration to simulate the feeling of pressing a button. What makes this knob unique is that it is mounted to a brushless DC motor, allowing for software-configurable end stops. These end stops can support multiple full revolutions and virtual snap points, providing a satisfying snap when crossing the center point or a spring-loaded knob that always returns to the center. The Smart Knob utilizes a high-resolution magnetic encoder chip for fine-grained control and enables virtual detents to match this high resolution. The size and granularity of these details can be adjusted in real-time, allowing for a seamless rotation experience. This video gives a brief overview of the capabilities of the Smart Knob and invites viewers to explore more about its design and construction through the provided open-source project links.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Arduino/Pi/SmartHome\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

Tutorial: https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-rfid-rc522/ Ultimate Books of Pi: https://pimylifeup.com/ultimate-book-of-pi/ The process of getting the circuit wired up correctly is pretty straightforward. There are seven pins that you will need to wire to the Raspberry Pi. To start this tutorial, you will need a few pieces of equipment. I have listed everything you will need right below. Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 4 Micro SD Card Power Supply RC522 RFID Reader Breadboard Breadboard Wire To ensure that you won't run into any issues, you need to make sure your RFID reader is the RC522 model. Other models might work, but I can't guarantee it. You may also need to solder some header pins to the RFID chip as many of them don't have them already pre-soldered. The code is pretty straightforward and will take you through the basics of interacting with the chip. Such as reading and writing to the RFID chip. We go into a lot more depth on both the circuitry and the Python code over at the website. So if you're seeking more information be sure to head over to pimylifeup.com I hope that this video on the Raspberry Pi RFID RC522 chip helps you with your project.

You can read more about the motorcycle here - https://devs.bike/pages/home.php Currently, the motorcycle uses a segment display and shows only basic information. The plan is to replace it with a full-color LCD panel, make it better looking and perhaps show more details. As a first step, I\u00b4m evaluating possible displays for the motorcycle. Since Arduino is not capable enough to drive a full-color LCD (and I don\u00b4t have time to learn new microcontrollers), my safest bet is to use an \"intelligent display\". There are two requirements - it has to fit into the current enclosure, so the size needs to be around 4.3\", and it has to be sunlight readable - i.e., to have a brightness of at least 800nits. There are 4 displays that meet the criteria: Display Visions - https://www.lcd-module.com/produkte/unitftshigh-end-pcap.html DWIN - https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCsHlE1 Stone - https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFII0FP 4D - https://4dsystems.com.au/ulcd-43d Nextion Display - https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Des6DHn Unfortunately, the 4D Display is out of stock and will not be available in the next 5 or 6 months. Since this project needs to be finished sooner, this display is already out of consideration. There is one more Intelligent Display brand - Nextion. The Nextion display is very easy to use and one of my favorite displays, but unfortunately, the brightness is only around 300 nits. So it\u00b4s definitely not sunlight readable. I\u00b4m still including it in this video since, again, it\u00b4s probably the easiest to use, and someone might find it suitable for some projects. If you have any questions, please put those down in the comment section, and I will try to answer those there or in the following video. Thank you very much for watching my videos, and I hope to see you soon! Good luck with your projects.\n</video_description>\n<video_summary>\nThe video is about a friend of the YouTuber who is building electric motorbikes and asked for help in replacing the current segment display with a color LCD display. The YouTuber agreed to help but with the requirement that they record all the progress, findings, and details on their YouTube channel. They explain that driving a color LCD requires more than just an Arduino microcontroller, so they opt for an intelligent display. They discuss different options for intelligent displays, including their brightness, resolution, and compatibility with the current enclosure. They also mention that they will go over each display in the next video and determine which one is the best for the project. The YouTuber hopes that the last video in the series will be them riding the electric motorcycle.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Arduino/Pi/SmartHome\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

Accessibility is my focus with Modern Builds, not simply accessibility of designs, but accessibility in materials, information, and projects themselves. I've focused on creating furniture and DIY projects that are simple enough that any beginner maker can accomplish, yet interesting enough that any expert might be inspired. Building and making is becoming less and less of an exclusive hobby and profession. My goal is to reduce that separation even further.\n</video_description>\n<video_summary>\nIn this video, Mike demonstrates the process of building three dining table and bench sets for a trendy restaurant called Kitchen in the Desert. He starts by cutting and processing the cedar boards, then assembles them using pocket holes and glue. Mike applies a heavy-duty outdoor finish to the tables and installs the pre-fabricated powder-coated legs. He also adds additional support to the benches by attaching a 2x6 board to the bottom. After delivering the tables to the restaurant, Mike talks about the pricing and profitability of the project. Overall, the project turns out successful, and Mike is happy with the outcome. He encourages aspiring woodworkers to consider the value of design and recommends resources for learning about establishing a day rate and making quotes for client work.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Woodworking/DIY\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

This method uses the GPU as an identifier, similar to how a cookie is used to track users across browsing sessions. The researchers discovered that by timing how long it takes a browser to perform certain graphics rendering tasks using WebGL, they can create unique fingerprints for specific graphics cards. The variability in performance among identical GPUs during manufacturing is what the technique takes advantage of. While the accuracy of GPU fingerprinting varies depending on the device, it can be combined with other fingerprinting techniques to better track users. The video also suggests ways to prevent websites from using WebGL to fingerprint users, such as disabling WebGL or using a password manager like RoboForm for enhanced online security.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Development/AI\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

That is what we did for this Stuffed Beef Tenderloin recipe cooked on the Oklahoma Joes Judge Charcoal Grill. Filleted open and lathered with a Horseradish Garlic Paste, we grilled this guy over the fire until it was medium rare perfection. Served with a side of Chipotle Beef Sauce for dipping, it is an awesome twist for this #grilllingseason.

The tenderloin is filleted and filled with a mixture of horseradish, garlic, herbs, and salt, then rolled up and tied with butcher twine. The outside of the tenderloin is coated with Dijon mustard and seasoned with salt and black pepper. It is then cooked on a preheated grill at 400 degrees, rotating and basting it with melted butter. Meanwhile, a Chipotle beef sauce is prepared with butter, beef broth, flour, salt, and chipotle puree, simmering it. Once the steak reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees, it is taken off the grill and topped with leftover butter, allowing it to rest for 15 minutes before being sliced and served with the beef sauce. The result is a mouthwatering and delicious dish.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Cooking\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

Slice the pork shoulder into about 1-cm slices, then transfer to a large dish or bowl. In a bowl, combine the achiote powder, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, cumin, salt, pepper, vinegar, and pineapple juice, mashing and stirring until smooth with no lumps. Pour the marinade over the pork, then toss the pork slices to make sure that they are all coated on all sides. Wrap the dish/bowl in cling film then marinate the pork for at least 2 hours, up to 3-5 days in the refrigerator. On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil, place down a slice or two of the pineapple. Take a wooden skewer and push it directly in the middle of the pineapple. Remove the pork from the fridge and push the slices through the skewer, layering one after the other until there is a 1-inch gap at the top. Push another pineapple slice on top. Bake for about an hour and a half, until slightly charred on the outside and deep red. Rest the meat for about 10 minutes, then carve off thin slices of the pork. Slice off thin pieces of the roasted pineapples as well. To assemble and serve, place some pork on the tortillas, followed by a few pieces of pineapple, a sprinkle of onions, a pinch of cilantro, then a small spoonful of the salsa. Enjoy!

BBQ SHRIMP SERVES 4 AS AN APPETIZER \u201cBarbecue shrimp\u201d originated at Pascal\u2019s Manale Restaurant & Bar in New Orleans in the 1950\u2019s and became hugely popular. When I was getting ready to open Emeril\u2019s, I developed my own white tablecloth version, with a kicked-up flavor base that simmered for hours. It\u2019s still a signature dish at Emeril\u2019s. Here I simplify my interpretation for the home cook, served with jalapeno biscuits. SHRIMP 24 large head-on shrimp (about 2 pounds), peeled and deveined, tails left on, shells and heads reserved. 1 tablespoon cracked black peppercorns 2 teaspoons Emeril\u2019s Essence (recipe follows) 1 \u00bd teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup dry white wine 3 cups water \u00be cup Worcestershire sauce Juice from 2 lemons (about \u00bc cup) \u00bd cup chopped onion 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon hot sauce \u00bc cup (\u00bd stick) unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces Jalapeno Biscuits, for serving (recipe follows) In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp with half of the cracked pepper, 1 teaspoon Essence, and the rosemary until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat. Add the shrimp shells and heads, the remaining \u00bd tablespoon pepper and 1 teaspoon Essence, and cook, stirring a few times, for 3 minutes. Add wine, water, Worcestershire, lemon juice, onion, garlic, and hot sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and let gently bubble for 45 minutes. Strain through a coarse strainer; you should have about 1 cup of barbecue base. Heat a 14-inch skillet over high heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, then shrimp and cook for 2 minutes, searing on both sides. Pour in the barbecue base, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until the shrimp are cooked through, about 1 minute.

The YouTuber explains that the sauce can be stored for a week by adding a 50/50 blend of red wine vinegar and lime juice when needed. The video then transitions to grilling the marinated flap steak on a hot charcoal grill. The steak is cooked on indirect heat to render the fat before being seared to achieve a charred exterior. After resting, the steak is sliced against the grain and served with the chimichurri sauce. The YouTuber encourages viewers to give this recipe a try and expresses their love for the dish.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Cooking\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

I take a couple of well marbled ribeye steaks and coat them with a drizzle of olive oil. Each steak is generously seasoned with my King Craw cajun seasoning and rested for 30 minutes to let those flavors sink into the meat. While the steaks rest, I fired up my trusty Weber kettle grill topped with a set of grill grates for searing. I also made a quick \u201cBayou Butter\u201d to tops these steaks at the end of the cook. The butter is a mixture of stone ground mustard, more King Craw Cajun seasoning, dried parsley and a stick of softened butter. Once it\u2019s mixed up I simply wrap it into a log form using plastic wrap and stick it back into the refrigerator to firm up. Once the grill is ready for action, both steaks hit the hot grill grates. You want the surface temp to be in the 550\u00b0F range for searing. Grill each steak for 90 seconds then rotate 90\u00b0 to create perfect grill marks. Cook for another 90 seconds and flip each steak. Repeat the same cooking process on the back side for a perfectly cook medium rare ribeye. If you want your steak a little more done increase each time by 30 seconds and it\u2019ll turn out medium. (Don\u2019t cook a ribeye past medium, please!) Top each steak with a pat of the Bayou Butter right at the last turn. This will allow the butter to melt over the steak as it finishes cooking. Remove the steaks from the grill and give them a rest for 5-7 minutes before serving. To make a pan-dipping sauce place another pat of butter under each steak while they rest. The butter will melt and combine with the juices from the steaks and it\u2019s Delicious! Cajun Ribeye Recipe - 2 Ribeye Steaks - 1/4 cup Olive Oil - 2 Tablespoons Malcom's King Craw Cajun Seasoning Bayou Butter - 1 stick Butter - softened at room temp - 1 Tablespoon Creole or Stone Ground Mustard - 1 Tablespoon Malcom's King Craw Cajun Seasoning - 1 teaspoon dried Parsley Flakes Combine butter, mustard, Cajun seasoning and parsley in a bowl. Spread onto plastic wrap and form into a log shape wrapping the plastic wrap tight. Store in refrigerator until ready to use. Cajun Ribeye Directions 1. Drizzle ribeyes with olive oil 2. Season generously with Cajun seasoning and rest at room temp for 30 minutes 3. Prepare charcoal grill for searing at 550 degrees using grill grates. 4. Place each steak in grill and cook for 1 minute 30 seconds. 5. Turn steak 90 degrees to a new spot on\n</video_description>\n<video_summary>\nIn this video, Malcolm Reed shows viewers how to make a delicious Cajun ribeye on the barbecue. He starts by making a bayou butter sauce with softened butter, mustard, cajun seasoning, and parsley flakes. After seasoning the ribeyes with olive oil and cajun seasoning, he grills them for about 3 minutes on each side. Once cooked, he tops the ribeyes with the bayou butter and lets them rest before slicing. The result is a flavorful and perfectly cooked ribeye with a Cajun twist. Malcolm suggests serving it with dirty rice or potatoes for a complete meal.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\n\"Cooking\"\n</video_classification>"}]}

The facility, more than one million square feet, emphasizes flexibility and adaptability in workplace design, unlike Google's more recreational Silicon Valley offices. The architecture involves nine new floors and maintains large, open spaces that accommodate diverse working styles, emphasizing natural light and an environment that fosters productivity and innovation.\n\nThe terminal's design reflects a shift towards a workspace suited for business professionals rather than engineers, featuring meeting rooms and lounge areas that encourage informal interactions. Additionally, the office incorporates modular elements that allow teams to rearrange spaces according to their needs. With an emphasis on biophilic design, the office incorporates native plants and features that enhance connections to nature while blending seamlessly into its urban setting.

They emphasize that the difficulty often stems from not having established mental frameworks or models to structure responses effectively. The speaker introduces a specific framework called \"PREP,\" which stands for Point, Reason, Example, and Point (reiterated). This framework helps individuals organize their thoughts into coherent and concise communication. For example, when discussing the need for automation in a workplace, one can clearly state their point, explain the reasoning, provide an example, and then restate the point for clarity. The speaker argues that many people struggle in meetings due to a lack of frameworks, resulting in vague discussions. By learning and applying different frameworks, such as PREP, individuals can enhance their communication skills and become more effective in various situations.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nWork/Growth\n</video_classification>"}]}

With only 56,000 residents and extreme cold conditions, Greenland aims to enhance its accessibility and boost its economy, particularly through tourism, which it heavily depends on. The main airport in Nuuk is undergoing significant upgrades while two additional airports are being built in other key locations, catering mainly to domestic flights.\n\nThe complexity of construction in such remote and harsh conditions is highlighted, detailing challenges like severe weather, the need for specialized excavation techniques involving explosives, and the logistical hurdles of transporting materials. While the endeavor is costly\u2014around $700 million, significantly impacting Greenland's GDP\u2014the potential economic benefits from increased tourism are projected to be substantial.\n\nDespite delays primarily due to COVID-19 and logistical issues, the video emphasizes that building these airports represents a transformative opportunity for Greenland, reshaping its future and making it more accessible while showcasing human ingenuity in overcoming geographical challenges.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nScience/History\n</video_classification>"}]}

Created by Mehmed Iden, who initially had humble beginnings as a dishwasher and aspiring rapper, Chick Bank attracted over 130,000 investors, accumulating around $250 million. However, it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, with profits paid to existing players sourced from new investments rather than genuine agricultural operations. \n\nAs complaints emerged and financial regulators began to investigate, Iden fled to Uruguay, where he lived a lavish lifestyle before ultimately turning himself into the Turkish authorities in 2021. Facing charges that could lead to 89,000 years in prison, he returned to Turkey nearly empty-handed after allegedly embezzling millions.

Using relatable analogies, he describes how different observers\u2014such as a barn and a ladder moving at near-light speed\u2014can perceive the same event in contradictory ways yet both be correct. This leads to the concept of the relativity of simultaneity, which posits that perspectives can vary significantly based on relative motion. The host emphasizes that understanding these concepts is crucial for grasping the non-intuitive nature of the universe, backed by practical implications such as the functionality of GPS systems. The video concludes by highlighting real-world experiments that affirm Einstein\u2019s theories, showcasing how time dilation, though subtle, is proven in everyday life.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nScience/History\n</video_classification>"}]}

He delves into the historical context of the Soviet space program, detailing the challenges faced in the design and launch of Sputnik 3, which was initially intended to be the first satellite. Despite hurdles, including technical issues with the R7 rocket and a failed first launch, Sputnik 3 was successfully placed into orbit in May 1958. It was a substantially larger and more complex satellite compared to its American counterparts. While it generated valuable scientific data, limitations in data recording hindered its historical contributions. Manley highlights the Soviet focus on being first in the space race, which sometimes led to missed opportunities for deeper scientific understanding. Ultimately, Sputnik 3 marked the beginning of continuous Soviet presence in space, operating for several years and playing a crucial role in the early days of space exploration.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nScience/History\n</video_classification>"}]}

Kennedy's medical history and possible drug use, particularly focusing on his relationship with a doctor known as \"Dr. Feelgood,\" who reportedly prescribed him amphetamines for chronic pain and depression. The speaker also explores a purported connection between JFK and LSD, citing an anecdote from Timothy Leary about a woman named Mary Pino, who was rumored to be a lover of JFK. Pino sought LSD from Leary, intending to use it with a \"powerful friend\" in April 1963. The video suggests that shortly after her LSD experience, JFK delivered a significant \"peace speech\" that signaled a shift in his Cold War rhetoric, advocating for cooperation with the Soviet Union and criticizing the arms race. The speaker speculates that this change may have provoked those invested in the military-industrial complex, potentially contributing to JFK's assassination. The narrative also mentions the mysterious circumstances of Pino's death and the loss of her diary, which could have provided more insights into the connection between JFK and LSD. Ultimately, the video raises questions about the influences on JFK's political decisions and the factors leading to his assassination.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nPodcast/Comedy\n</video_classification>"}]}

BIG DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert, I don\u2019t work for YC and haven\u2019t been in one of the new, remote-only batches. YC is constantly evolving and improving their process for finding great companies, so I encourage you to get multiple opinions here and try and find advice directly from YC partners themselves. That being said, here\u2019s what\u2019s worked for me, and what I think is generally true about the YC application and interview process. ABOUT Y COMBINATOR: Y Combinator (YC) is an American seed investment startup accelerator launched in March 2005. It has been used to launch over 2,000 companies, including Stripe, Airbnb, Cruise Automation, DoorDash, Coinbase, Instacart, Dropbox, Twitch, and Reddit. The combined valuation of the top YC companies was over $300 billion as of January 2021. The company's accelerator program is held in Mountain View, California. Y Combinator was founded in 2005 by Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell, and Robert Tappan Morris. From 2005 to 2008, one program was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and one was held in Mountain View, California. As Y Combinator grew to 40 investments per year, running two programs became too much. In January 2009, Y Combinator announced that the Cambridge program would be closed and all future programs would take place in Silicon Valley. In 2009, Sequoia Capital led the $2 million investment round into an entity of Y Combinator to enable them to invest in approximately 60 companies a year. The following year, Sequoia led an $8.25 million funding round for Y Combinator to further increase the number of startups the company could fund. Then, in 2011, Yuri Milner and SV Angel offered every Y Combinator company a $150,000 convertible note investment. The amount put into each company was changed to $80,000 when Start Fund was renewed. In September 2013, Paul Graham announced Y Combinator would fund nonprofit organizations that were accepted into the program after having tested the concept with Watsi (while continuing to fund mostly for-profit startups). In 2014, founder Paul Graham announced he was stepping down and that Sam Altman would take over as president of Y Combinator. That same year, Altman announced \"The New Deal\" for YC startups, which offers $150,000 for 7% equity. Late in 2014, Sam Altman announced a partnership with Transcriptic to provide increased support for Y Combinator's growing community of biotech companies. Then in 2015, he announced a partnership with Bolt and increased support for hardware companies. The YC Fellowship Program was announced in July 2015, with the goal of funding companies at the idea or prototype stage. The first batch of YC Fellowship included 32 companies that received an equity-free grant instead of an investment. In January 2016, Y Combinator announced version 2 of the Fellowship program, with participating companies receiving $20k investment for a 1.5% equity stake. The equity stake is\n</video_description>\n<video_summary>\nIn this video, John Coogan shares insights about Y Combinator (YC), a prominent startup accelerator he has firsthand experience with as a co-founder of two companies that went through the program. He discusses the structure of YC, including the $125,000 investment for a 7% equity stake, a three-month intensive program, and the culminating demo day where startups pitch to investors. Coogan emphasizes that YC is especially beneficial for first-time entrepreneurs, providing not only capital but also a vibrant community within Silicon Valley.\n\nKey points include the application process, which requires only a team and an idea\u2014traction or revenue is not mandatory. He explains that potential applicants should focus on building their startup rather than over-preparing their applications. Coogan also discusses the interview format, emphasizing the need to communicate key aspects of the startup succinctly within a brief interview time frame, typically 10 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, he addresses the possibility of rejection, noting that many successful founders did not gain acceptance on their first attempt. Coogan encourages aspiring entrepreneurs to apply regardless of their business stage but warns against applying if they\u2019re not intent on significantly growing their company. Overall, he motivates viewers with personal anecdotes and expert advice, urging them to take the plunge into applying to YC if they are committed to their startup vision.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nStartup/Business\n</video_classification>"}]}

The video begins by detailing the struggles faced by someone on a $25,000 salary, highlighting challenges in affording basic necessities, housing, food, and healthcare. It illustrates how this financial constraint often leads to stress, debt, and an inability to save for emergencies or improvements in quality of life.\n\nAs the video progresses, it contrasts this with income tiers of $40,000, $100,000, and up to $1 million, showing how each increase in salary allows for greater spending on housing, food, and transportation, as well as improved healthcare access and lifestyle flexibility. Finally, at the $25 million income level, individuals enjoy extreme luxury, with access to a personal staff, private jets, and expansive wealth management strategies, amplifying their disconnect from the challenges faced by lower-income earners.\n\nThe creator emphasizes the growing divide between the rich and the poor, discussing the implications of this wealth accumulation on social mobility, economic equity, and the overall wellbeing of society. The video concludes with a call to recognize and address these economic disparities, suggesting a need for systemic change to alleviate the financial burdens faced by lower-income individuals like George, who represents millions in a similarly challenging position.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nGeneral Entertainment/News/Politics/Shows\n</video_classification>"}]}

The FEC, composed of six members\u2014three Republicans and three Democrats\u2014has struggled with partisan division, particularly over the past 15 years, which has rendered it ineffective in enforcing campaign finance laws. Recent shifts, particularly following the appointment of Democratic Commissioner Dara Lindenbaum, have led to the FEC facilitating greater coordination between super PACs and political campaigns, allowing unlimited contributions for state ballot measures. These changes have raised alarms about the influx of dark money into elections, undermining the integrity of the electoral process and making it harder for the average voter to be heard. The video emphasizes that both parties have contributed to this issue, with some Democrats now supporting looser funding regulations, complicating the landscape further. Ultimately, the FEC's dysfunction underlines a broader trend in which the political influence of wealthy interests increasingly overshadows the voices of everyday Americans.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nGeneral Entertainment/News/Politics/Shows\n</video_classification>"}]}

It outlines how the Kurds were initially able to maintain autonomy under the Ottoman Empire but lost their prospect for an independent Kurdistan after World War I when European powers drew borders through their territories, splitting them into five different countries\u2014Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. \n\nThroughout the 20th century, the Kurds attempted to assert their rights through various means, including uprisings and political movements, often meeting with violent repression from the respective governments. The video highlights several key events, such as the genocidal attacks on Kurds in Iraq during Saddam Hussein's regime, the repression faced in Turkey, and the temporary autonomy achieved in Iraq post-Saddam.\n\nIt also addresses the complex geopolitical dynamics involving the Kurds, where outside powers, such as the US and Soviet Union, have manipulated Kurdish forces for their strategic interests while often abandoning them. The relationship between the US and Kurdish forces in the fight against ISIS is also examined, illustrating how Kurdish groups became crucial allies against ISIS yet were later left vulnerable when the US withdrew its support.\n\nOverall, the Kurdish struggle is depicted as one marked by resilience and sacrifice in the face of oppression while also being a pawn in broader geopolitical conflicts. The video emphasizes the Kurds' ongoing fight for recognition, autonomy, and cultural preservation amidst a backdrop of shifting political alliances and historical injustices.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nGeneral Entertainment/News/Politics/Shows\n</video_classification>"}]}

Starting with a standard Nerf blaster that fires at about 60 ft/s, the creator explores various designs and technologies, ultimately drawing inspiration from advanced air cannons. After extensive research and multiple experiments, including modifications involving high-pressure air systems and complex valve designs, the creator assembles a custom blaster capable of achieving impressive speeds.\n\nThrough trial and error, including challenges with pressure and valve functionality, the creator learns about the physics behind the blaster's operation and the limitations of standard Nerf darts, which tend to break at high speeds. Notably, at pressures of around 400-450 PSI, the blaster achieves supersonic speeds while preventing the darts from breaking.\n\nThe video captures the inventive process, highlighting both the frustrations and successes encountered along the way. It concludes with the creator achieving a supersonic shot and invites viewers to suggest targets for future experiments, promising a follow-up video to showcase more tests.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nGeneral Entertainment/News/Politics/Shows\n</video_classification>"}]}

She was 66. As a child growing up in rural Mississippi, Lusia \u201cLucy\u201d Harris often stayed up past her bedtime watching her favorite N.B.A. players, dreaming of one day playing on the same courts. Reaching 6 feet 3 inches by the time she was in high school, Harris was often called \u201clong and tall and that\u2019s all\u201d by her classmates \u2014 but she knew her height would be an asset on the court. And she wasn\u2019t just tall enough to play the game. She was a rare talent who would go on to be a three-time national college champion and an Olympic silver medalist, making her a national sensation by the time she finished her college career. For an electrifying young basketball player on the national stage, success often comes with a lucrative professional contract and brand deals \u2014 but Harris\u2019s moment came in the 1970s, decades before the W.N.B.A. was founded, when few opportunities were available to female athletes interested in pursuing a professional career. In Ben Proudfoot's \"The Queen of Basketball,\" Harris tells the story of what happens when an unstoppable talent runs out of games to win.

Lusia's journey began playing basketball as a child, leading to her being drafted by the New Orleans Jazz, making her the first woman officially drafted by a men's basketball team. She had a successful college career at Delta State University, where she helped the team win three consecutive national championships and became a dominant force on the court.\n\nThe video highlights the challenges she faced, including being the only Black player on her team and the lack of opportunities for women in basketball during her time, such as the absence of a professional league like the WNBA. Lusia became the first woman to score in Olympic women's basketball history, winning a silver medal in the process. \n\nAfter retiring from basketball, she faced personal challenges, including struggling with bipolar disorder and feeling disconnected from her past fame. Eventually, she found fulfillment through coaching and raising her family. The video reflects on her legacy as a pioneer in women's sports, her humility, and how she is remembered as one of the greatest female players of all time.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nGeneral Entertainment/News/Politics/Shows\n</video_classification>"}]}

Help keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (\ud83d\udd14) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO There are film franchises, and then there are shared universes. Halloween, Scream, The Exorcist are all successful horror franchises. For the most part, they follow one continuous story. Their sequels, re-quels, and reboots all tend to center around the same villain we\u2019ve known since the beginning. But The Conjuring is different. Every new film pulls on threads from real-life hauntings , creating a wider universe \u2014 much like the Marvel Cinematic universe. Except instead of building out its roster of heroes, The Conjuring builds out a roster of villains. The Conjurings universe is based on the case files of two of the most famous paranormal investigators of all time: Ed and Lorraine Warren. Whether or not their stories were 100% true is debatable, but one thing is clear: They make for great entertainment. Their case files have been used as the basis for horror films since the \u201870s, but they really gained traction in 2013 with The Conjuring. In the 10 years since, the Conjuring has become the highest-grossing horror franchise of all time. Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.

It highlights their background, with Ed being a demonologist and Lorraine a trance medium, and covers their investigations of various hauntings, including cases involving demonic presences and haunted objects. The Warrens eventually became central figures in horror cinema with the release of \"The Conjuring\" in 2013, which shifted the portrayal of their cases into a successful franchise. The film's success is attributed to its blend of emotional storytelling, genuine scares, and reverence for real-life events, with Lorraine even serving as a consultant. The video also notes the clever marketing strategies, budget efficiency, and the interconnected nature of the Conjuring universe, all while acknowledging the Warrens\u2019 legacy and the numerous untold stories in the realm of the paranormal.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nGeneral Entertainment/News/Politics/Shows\n</video_classification>"}]}

The reviewer appreciates the luxurious and comfortable interior, citing high-quality materials and tech features, but feels the software interface looks dated. Despite acknowledging the SUV's performance capabilities and superior interior comfort, they ultimately prefer competitors like the Tesla Model X Plaid and BMW models due to better range and storage.

It begins with the SAS operators launching from Jordan to attack a suspected chemical plant in Iraq, amid the backdrop of rising tensions and the impending military action sanctioned by U.S. President George W. Bush. The video discusses the geopolitical context, including the legacy of the Gulf War and claims of weapons of mass destruction that justified the invasion.\n\nAs the SAS undertake reconnaissance missions and engage in skirmishes with Iraqi forces, they encounter heavy resistance, leading to tactical withdrawals and air support requests. The narration emphasizes the urgency of the operations as political maneuvers unfold, culminating in the launch of the ground invasion on March 20, 2003, which occurs ahead of the planned air offensive due to the increased alert level of Iraqi defenses. The video captures the intensity of military preparations, the risks involved in covert operations, and the challenges faced by the SAS as they implement their part in the larger Coalition strategy against Saddam Hussein's regime.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nScience/History\n</video_classification>"}]}

Inspired by the iconic Total War series, this tutorial is perfect for developers looking to add dynamic camera controls to their games. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udd35 What's Inside: In this video, we begin with a basic setup using the top-down starter template in Unreal Engine and then dive into the creation of a custom Camera Pawn and Game Mode class. The setup will teach you everything from setting up your game mode to designate the CameraPawn as the default Player Pawn class, to creating and configuring a blueprint class for your camera. Our focus then shifts to implementing the Camera Pawn. This video covers enabling the mouse cursor in the Begin Play function to handling camera movement based on user input in the Tick function. You'll learn how to use keyboard input, mouse position, and viewport size to achieve smooth camera movement, along with customizing movement speed and screen edge padding. Next, we explore the exciting part of this build - Enhanced Input Actions. We demonstrate how to add MappingContext and set up event handling from Input Actions. This includes creating event bindings for movement (WASD keys), zoom (mouse wheel), and rotation (middle mouse button), ensuring a fully interactive camera experience. As we progress, you'll see how to configure Action Properties in the Unreal Editor, assign them to your blueprint, and finally, implement the input event functions.

It explains that this problem is often misunderstood, with many attributing it to faulty regulators or the grill itself. Instead, the main culprit is a safety device within the propane regulator that can restrict propane flow, especially if the tank valve is opened too quickly. \n\nTo fix this, the video provides a simple method: open the propane tank valve slowly and keep the burner valves off initially. If the grill still doesn't ignite, a reset procedure for the regulator is suggested, involving closing the tank valve and allowing the regulator to self-reset or manually releasing gas. \n\nThe video also offers tips for dealing with overfilled propane tanks and emphasizes the importance of proper regulator installation, including avoiding thread sealants. Lastly, it encourages viewers to perform a soapy water test for leaks after connecting the regulator. Throughout, the speaker aims to demystify gas grill maintenance and provide troubleshooting tips for consistent grilling performance.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nWoodworking/DIY\n</video_classification>"}]}

It traces the origins of this theory from literary references, such as H.G. Wells' 1901 novel \"The First Men in the Moon,\" to real scientific inquiries, including erroneous calculations of the Moon's density and speculative ideas from Soviet scientists in the 1970s. The video discusses how subsequent Apollo missions gathered seismic data indicating that the Moon is less dense than expected but not hollow. Misinterpretations of scientific statements, notably by Professor Clive Neal, contributed to renewed interest in the conspiracy theory. Ultimately, the video emphasizes that while there are many conspiracy theories, scientific evidence supports the Moon's natural formation and its shared origin with Earth.

It begins by contextualizing the war within the backdrop of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which overthrew the Shah and established an Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khomeini. The revolution alarmed neighboring Sunni-led countries, including Iraq under Saddam Hussein, who feared the Shia uprising would inspire their own populations.\n\nSaddam seized the opportunity presented by Iran's weakened military to invade, seeking a quick victory to assert his dominance in the region and reclaim disputed territory. The conflict quickly turned brutal, resembling the trench warfare of World War I, with both countries suffering extensive casualties and devastation.\n\nAs the war progressed, external powers like the US and Soviet Union intervened, often supporting Iraq while turning a blind eye to Saddam\u2019s human rights violations, including the use of chemical weapons. The war also saw brutal tactics employed, such as missile attacks on civilian populations, resulting in widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\nThe video highlights the war's lasting effects, as it solidified Iran\u2019s hostile stance towards the West and shaped Saddam\u2019s future actions that led to the Gulf War. It concludes by emphasizing that the divisions and conflicts in the Middle East today are deeply rooted in the consequences of the Iran-Iraq War, which altered regional dynamics and set the stage for subsequent conflicts.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nGeneral Entertainment/News/Politics/Shows\n</video_classification>"}]}

The approach identifies key patterns of tactics implemented by rival teams, and figures out effective responses, a huge achievement for modern football. Petar is a Staff Research Scientist at Google DeepMind, Affiliated Lecturer at the University of Cambridge, and an Associate of Clare Hall, Cambridge. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge (Trinity College). (Note: There was a minor mistake in the intro, Petar was at Mila when he invented graph attention networks, not DM) https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/tacticai-ai-assistant-for-football-tactics/ https://petar-v.com/ https://twitter.com/PetarV_93/ Support MLST: Please support us on Patreon.

Tactic AI serves as an AI assistant designed to enhance football tactics by leveraging geometric deep learning and graph neural networks. The main focus is on analyzing corner kick situations, where Tactic AI can predict outcomes and suggest optimal player setups, leading to tactical solutions that are often preferred over existing strategies.\n\nPeta explains the technical aspects of Tactic AI, emphasizing its ability to capture player interactions and model their relationships using graphs, which helps improve prediction accuracy. The model has been validated with expert feedback, showing that its suggestions are indistinguishable from real-life tactics 90% of the time. The conversation addresses the implications of such technology for coaching strategies, allowing coaches to focus less on analyzing past situations and more on creative decision-making during games. The system is seen as a way to foster creativity and innovation in football tactics by liberating coaches from the detailed analysis of prior plays. \n\nOverall, the video underscores the exciting potential of AI in sports, particularly in enhancing tactical understanding and decision-making processes.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nDevelopment/AI\n</video_classification>"}]}

A perfect number is defined as a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. The only known perfect numbers are even, such as 6, 28, and 496, following a formula established by the ancient mathematician Euclid. Despite extensive efforts by mathematicians over the past 2000 years, no odd perfect numbers have been found. \n\nThe video chronicles the historical context, prominent figures in mathematics like Euclid, Nicomachus, and Euler, and various conjectures and discoveries surrounding perfect numbers. It highlights the challenges in proving whether odd perfect numbers exist, detailing advances in computing and mathematical theories used to explore this problem. Researchers have established significant bounds (now computed to more than 10^2200) for where an odd perfect number could exist if it were to be found, indicating the immense difficulty of the challenge.\n\nThe video concludes by arguing for the importance of studying such abstract mathematical problems, noting that curiosity-driven research often leads to significant advancements, such as those found in cryptography and foundational mathematics. The discussion emphasizes that while the problem currently lacks practical applications, the pursuit of knowledge in mathematics remains valuable.\n</video_summary>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<video_classification>\nScience/History\n</video_classification>"}]}
