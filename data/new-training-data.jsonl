This can be used for inventory management systems, CRM platforms, and reporting dashboards. The third idea is building communities and social networks, where monetization opportunities include selling directly to community members, providing sponsorships, and advertising. The speaker provides a list of no-code tools that can be used to build these startup ideas, such as Softr, Webflow, Airtable, Zapier, Bubble, Sharetribe, Glide, and Adalo.

In this video we go through real-world examples and demonstrate how each component contributes to the effectiveness of the prompt (aka the better the prompt, the better the output)! The Task sentence needs to articulate the end goal and start with an action verb. Use three guiding questions to help structure relevant and sufficient Context. Exemplars can drastically improve the quality of the output by giving specific examples for the AI to reference. For Persona, think of who you would ideally want the AI to be in the given task situation. Visualizing your desired end result will let you know what format to use in your prompt.

The first method is fine-tuning, which involves training the large language model with private data to achieve desired behaviors. The second method is creating a knowledge base, where an embedding or vector database is used to provide relevant data to the language model. Fine-tuning is useful for creating a knowledge model with specific behaviors, while embedding is better for providing accurate data based on domain knowledge. The video also provides a step-by-step case study on how to fine-tune a large language model for creating military prompts using the Falcon model. The speaker explains the process of choosing a model, preparing the dataset, implementing training, and saving and uploading the trained model. The results of fine-tuning are shown to be more effective than using the base model or chat GPT alone. The speaker suggests exploring different use cases for fine-tuning, such as customer support, legal documents, medical diagnosis, and financial advisories.

The video then introduces the concept of the speed of light as a constant, which leads to the need for a new understanding of space and time. The video explains the Lorenz transformations, which allow for changes in reference frames while preserving the speed of light. It goes on to discuss special relativity, which involves time and space warping and changing depending on the observer. The video draws an analogy between space-time transformations and rotations on a map, with the Lawrence Transformations being hyperbolic rotations. It explains how these transformations preserve certain aspects of the diagram, like straight lines and volumes. The video also discusses how space-time unifies the concepts of acceleration, electric and magnetic fields, and momentum and energy. It concludes by mentioning that space-time can be distorted, leading to the theory of general relativity, and mentions ongoing research and theories about the nature of space-time at a fundamental level.\"}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Science/History\""}]}

Eventually, the walls are breached and the city is overwhelmed by the enemy. The Imperial army proceeds to engage in looting, violence, and destruction, committing war crimes and causing immense suffering to the residents. The Swiss Guard and some Roman citizens make a last stand in the Vatican, but they are eventually forced to retreat to Castel Sant'Angelo.

Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLP What causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging. Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.

He addresses concerns about the potential for increased sickness and inequality, and focuses on extending the healthy lifespan (health span). The host discusses the role of the epigenome in aging and the importance of maintaining it. He explains how certain genes, such as sirtuins, AMP-kinase, and mTOR, can help slow aging and the steps individuals can take to maintain their epigenome. The host also interviews Professor Sinclair, who shares his research on reversing aging in mice by resetting the epigenome. He discusses the possibility of using the jellyfish's ability to reset their cells as a model for human aging. Although reversing aging in the entire human body is still far off, there is a roadmap and potential for slowing and even reversing aging in the future.

What is a Roth IRA The Roth IRA is an individual retirement account that anyone can start provided they have something called EARNED income. This means that you need to make wages/salaries/tips, so basically you need to have a pay stub or W2 or 1099 income. You can open a Roth IRA at almost any brokerage firm, and the main advantage of having a Roth IRA is that your earnings and profits are growing tax free. That means when you retire, and you withdraw all the earnings on this account, you won't pay ANY taxes on it. That's the biggest benefit of this account, so since all our earnings grow tax free - there are going to be some investing strategies that we can employ within the Roth IRA to really take advantage of this fact. 2. What's in MY Roth IRA? My Roth IRA has around 29k invested and holds the following: VTI, which is a Total Stock Market ETF - $13k VEU - gives you broad access to international markets that are developing and emerging - about $8.8k BNDW - 4k world bond ETF, this gives me access to bonds in the world VOO - $3.3k S&P 500 ETF. Now initially when I started my Roth IRA, I chose these three funds only, and the split at the time was 40% VTI, 40% VEU, and 20% BND. Now at the time, the reasoning was pretty simple, I was in my late 20s, I wanted to have exposure to the US and International stock markets, which are riskier than bonds, but I didnt want to be 100% in equities - and I wanted a passive investment that I did not have to actively manage, hence why I chose ETFs. Based on my risk tolerance at the time - which was moderate/moderately aggressive for the next 30+ years, I chose an 80/20 split of equities to bonds, and I wanted my equities to be hedged across US and emerging world, just in case something happened with the US market, I still had the international ones to bolster me up. This was diversifying\", \"Summary\": \"In this video, Humphrey discusses what is in his Roth IRA and provides tips on how to decide what to invest in your own Roth IRA. He starts by explaining the basics of a Roth IRA and its advantages, such as tax-free growth and withdrawals. Humphrey then goes on to share the four funds he holds in his Roth IRA: VTI (total stock market ETF), VEU (international markets ETF), BNDW (world bond ETF), and VO (S&P 500 ETF). He explains his reasoning behind these choices and how he wanted a mix of bonds and equities for diversification. Humphrey also discusses the differences between investing in individual stocks versus ETFs and funds. He emphasizes the importance of assessing risk tolerance, identifying one's investment style, and considering overall portfolio diversification when deciding what to invest in a Roth IRA. He also mentions other investment options like real estate investment trusts (REITs) and dividend stocks. Humphrey concludes by encouraging viewers to watch his video on a simple investing portfolio if they are looking for a straightforward approach.\"}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Finance\""}]}

To make the most of AI assistance, it's essential to provide high-quality prompts at each stage of the job search process. One effective way to utilize ChatGPT is by enhancing your networking skills. For instance, to connect with a professional on #LinkedIn, you can use ChatGPT to analyze their profile and generate a personalized connection request. Moreover, ChatGPT can help you come up with tailored questions to ask during coffee chats, showing the professional that you've done your homework and are serious about learning from them. ChatGPT can also help you compose follow-up emails after an interview, emphasizing your transferable skills and mentioning specific details from the conversation to show you were paying attention. Additionally, ChatGPT can guide you through salary negotiations by simulating a realistic conversation between a job seeker and a recruiter. By practicing with AI-generated responses, you can enter the negotiation process with more confidence and poise.

Since you can't feel the detents through the video, make sure to turn up the volume so you can at least hear them, particularly the fine-grained detents toward the end of the video. A brushless gimbal motor is paired with a magnetic encoder to provide closed-loop torque feedback control, enabling virtual endstops and detents. Internally, everything is powered by an ESP32, with a TMC6300 BLDC motor driver, HX711 strain gauge ADC, VEML7700 ambient light sensor, and more! I'll have a lot more to share about this project in the future, like a design and assembly overview, so make sure you're subscribed if you want to see more!

It consists of a smooth rotary encoder, a round LCD, and RGB LEDs. The device uses low-cost strain gauge sensors and a quick motor vibration to simulate the feeling of pressing a button. What makes this knob unique is that it is mounted to a brushless DC motor, allowing for software-configurable end stops. These end stops can support multiple full revolutions and virtual snap points, providing a satisfying snap when crossing the center point or a spring-loaded knob that always returns to the center. The Smart Knob utilizes a high-resolution magnetic encoder chip for fine-grained control and enables virtual detents to match this high resolution. The size and granularity of these details can be adjusted in real-time, allowing for a seamless rotation experience.

I will post all my findings and progress here, and hopefully, the last video in the series will be the motorcycle with the new display. You can read more about the motorcycle here - https://devs.bike/pages/home.php Currently, the motorcycle uses a segment display and shows only basic information. The plan is to replace it with a full-color LCD panel, make it better looking and perhaps show more details. As a first step, I\\u00b4m evaluating possible displays for the motorcycle. Since Arduino is not capable enough to drive a full-color LCD (and I don\\u00b4t have time to learn new microcontrollers), my safest bet is to use an \\\"intelligent display\\\". There are two requirements - it has to fit into the current enclosure, so the size needs to be around 4.3\\\", and it has to be sunlight readable - i.e., to have a brightness of at least 800nits. There are 4 displays that meet the criteria: Display Visions - https://www.lcd-module.com/produkte/unitftshigh-end-pcap.html DWIN - https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCsHlE1 Stone - https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFII0FP 4D - https://4dsystems.com.au/ulcd-43d Nextion Display - https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Des6DHn Unfortunately, the 4D Display is out of stock and will not be available in the next 5 or 6 months. Since this project needs to be finished sooner, this display is already out of consideration. There is one more Intelligent Display brand - Nextion. The Nextion display is very easy to use and one of my favorite displays, but unfortunately, the brightness is only around 300 nits. So it\\u00b4s definitely not sunlight readable. I\\u00b4m still including it in this video since, again, it\\u00b4s probably the easiest to use, and someone might find it suitable for some projects.

Accessibility is my focus with Modern Builds, not simply accessibility of designs, but accessibility in materials, information, and projects themselves. I've focused on creating furniture and DIY projects that are simple enough that any beginner maker can accomplish, yet interesting enough that any expert might be inspired. Building and making is becoming less and less of an exclusive hobby and profession. My goal is to reduce that separation even further.\", \"Summary\": \"In this video, Mike demonstrates the process of building three dining table and bench sets for a trendy restaurant called Kitchen in the Desert. He starts by cutting and processing the cedar boards, then assembles them using pocket holes and glue. Mike applies a heavy-duty outdoor finish to the tables and installs the pre-fabricated powder-coated legs. He also adds additional support to the benches by attaching a 2x6 board to the bottom. After delivering the tables to the restaurant, Mike talks about the pricing and profitability of the project. Overall, the project turns out successful, and Mike is happy with the outcome. He encourages aspiring woodworkers to consider the value of design and recommends resources for learning about establishing a day rate and making quotes for client work.\"}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Woodworking/DIY\""}]}

This method uses the GPU as an identifier, similar to how a cookie is used to track users across browsing sessions. The researchers discovered that by timing how long it takes a browser to perform certain graphics rendering tasks using WebGL, they can create unique fingerprints for specific graphics cards. The variability in performance among identical GPUs during manufacturing is what the technique takes advantage of. While the accuracy of GPU fingerprinting varies depending on the device, it can be combined with other fingerprinting techniques to better track users. The video also suggests ways to prevent websites from using WebGL to fingerprint users, such as disabling WebGL or using a password manager like RoboForm for enhanced online security.\"}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Development\""}]}

BBQ SHRIMP SERVES 4 AS AN APPETIZER \\u201cBarbecue shrimp\\u201d originated at Pascal\\u2019s Manale Restaurant & Bar in New Orleans in the 1950\\u2019s and became hugely popular. When I was getting ready to open Emeril\\u2019s, I developed my own white tablecloth version, with a kicked-up flavor base that simmered for hours. It\\u2019s still a signature dish at Emeril\\u2019s. Here I simplify my interpretation for the home cook, served with jalapeno biscuits. SHRIMP 24 large head-on shrimp (about 2 pounds), peeled and deveined, tails left on, shells and heads reserved. 1 tablespoon cracked black peppercorns 2 teaspoons Emeril\\u2019s Essence (recipe follows) 1 \\u00bd teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup dry white wine 3 cups water \\u00be cup Worcestershire sauce Juice from 2 lemons (about \\u00bc cup) \\u00bd cup chopped onion 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon hot sauce \\u00bc cup (\\u00bd stick) unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces Jalapeno Biscuits, for serving (recipe follows) In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp with half of the cracked pepper, 1 teaspoon Essence, and the rosemary until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat. Add the shrimp shells and heads, the remaining \\u00bd tablespoon pepper and 1 teaspoon Essence, and cook, stirring a few times, for 3 minutes. Add wine, water, Worcestershire, lemon juice, onion, garlic, and hot sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and let gently bubble for 45 minutes. Strain through a coarse strainer; you should have about 1 cup of barbecue base. Heat a 14-inch skillet over high heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, then shrimp and cook for 2 minutes, searing on both sides. Pour in the barbecue base, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until the shrimp are cooked through, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat; whisk in the butter, one piece at a time, not adding another until the previous piece is fully incorporated in the sauce. Transfer the shrimp to a serving platter or small individual plates. Spoon the sauce over the shrimp and serve immediately with jalapeno biscuits, if desired.

After simmering for 45 minutes and straining the base, Emeril cooks the shrimp halfway and adds the base to let them cook further and absorb the flavors. He finishes the dish by adding a small amount of butter and serves it with rosemary biscuits.

Repeat the same cooking process on the back side for a perfectly cook medium rare ribeye. If you want your steak a little more done increase each time by 30 seconds and it\\u2019ll turn out medium. (Don\\u2019t cook a ribeye past medium, please!) Top each steak with a pat of the Bayou Butter right at the last turn. This will allow the butter to melt over the steak as it finishes cooking. Remove the steaks from the grill and give them a rest for 5-7 minutes before serving. To make a pan-dipping sauce place another pat of butter under each steak while they rest. The butter will melt and combine with the juices from the steaks and it\\u2019s Delicious!
